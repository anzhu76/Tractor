# Tractor
Source code for Tractor for Android (it was a 20% project)
This is really ancient code.  This code is written by An Zhu and Qicheng Ma.  The code mostly used a simple greedy algorithm approach to solve Tractor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_ji).  The AI will remember all the cards played and then calculate the winning percentage of particular combination of cards.  Some heuristics are used, such as detect is a particular suit is missing among certain players.
